# Real-Time Network Traffic Prediction

This project leverages **deep learning techniques**, specifically **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**, to predict real-time network traffic. By analyzing real-world traffic data, we aim to provide insights into traffic patterns and improve the accuracy of network traffic forecasting.

## ðŸ“œ Introduction

The project applies advanced time-series models to forecast network traffic. Using a dataset from the **University of Leipzig**, we compare the effectiveness of LSTM and GRU models for future traffic predictions. The evaluation metrics include:

- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**

The results show that **LSTM outperforms GRU**, offering better generalization and accuracy.
